## 💬 About The Project

- Anime Subtitle Player is a video player that help people to learn Japanese through watching Anime with Japanese subtitle.

## ⏳ Timeline

- ✅ I started this project on Aug 6, 2023 because it's a bit annoying to use MKV player with a tab aside (it's make video too small 😠). Also, i want to make it easier for me to just hover directly to the subtitle in the video and get the definition of the word.

- ❌ I am not going to finish this project at a specific time cause i'm going to use this everyday and do more feature when i have time to make it better 😁.
